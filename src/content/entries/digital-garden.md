The defining feature of a [digital garden](https://twitter.com/wibomd/status/1703946098589548622) is the `[[wikiref]]` (or "[[wikirefs|bidirectional link]]"). By adding dense internal links, the pages of a site become descriptive of a topography of concepts which describe or are used in said site.

Techniques found in the wild are typically a mix derived from [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management), [personal wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki), [tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/), [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), and [evergreen notes](https://entries.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) among others.

_[[wikibonsai|WikiBonsai]]_ is the culmination and curation of what this particular gardener has learned and built.

Also, "gardening" is a surprisingly common metaphor that [pops up](https://twitter.com/wibomd/status/1704147337738654189) in many unexpected places.
