plugin::[[remark-wikirefs]]


`[[WikiRefs]]`[^names] are a crucial part of the world of [[digital-garden|digital gardening]]. They are the basic building block of the interlinking accomplished in many gardens, including this one. They are rendered with the [[remark-wikirefs]] plugin, are rendered in a different color than external web links, and you can check out those docs for more details.

But in short, This particular flavour of `[[wikirefs]]` includes three kinds of wiki constructs: wikiattrs, wikilinks, and wikiembeds.

_WikiAttrs_ are formalized attributes of a file. They include a descriptive attrtype and a wikilink to another file. They look `:like-this::[[wikilink]]` (with a newline after) and are rendered in the attributes box (attrbox).

_WikiLinks_ are traditional bidirectional links using the square bracket syntax and may appear anywhere in a file. There are `:typed::[[wikilinks]]` and regular untyped `[[wikilinks]]`. They are highlighted in a different color than external web links.

_WikiEmbeds_ embed the content of the linked file into the current one in-place. Markdown files may be embedded as well as images, audio, or video files. WikiEmbeds look like `![[this]]`.
